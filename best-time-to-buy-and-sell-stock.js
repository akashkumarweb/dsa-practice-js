/**
*Difficulty: Easy - Medium
*Topic: Array, Greedy

*Question:
    You are given an array prices where prices[i] is the price of a stock on day i.
    You want to maximize your profit by choosing a single day to buy one stock and a different day in the future to sell that stock.
    Return the maximum profit you can achieve from this transaction.If you cannot achieve any profit, return 0.

    *Input: prices = [7, 1, 5, 3, 6, 4]
    *Output: 5
    *Explanation: Buy on day 2 (price=1) and sell on day 5 (price=6), profit = 6-1 = 5.
